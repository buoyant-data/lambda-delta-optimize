= Delta Optimize Lambda

This Lambda function can be used with a periodic trigger to optimize a
configured link:https://delta.io[Delta Lake] table. Consult the `deployment.tf`
file for an example of how to provision the function in AWS.

== Building

Building and testing the Lambda can be done with cargo: `cargo test build`.

In order to deploy this in AWS Lambda, it must first be built with the `cargo
lambda` command line tool, e.g.:

[source,bash]
----
cargo lambda build --release --output-format zip
----

This will produce the file: `target/lambda/lambda-delta-optimize/bootstrap.zip`

== Infrastructure

The `deployment.tf` file contains the necessary Terraform to provision the
function, a DynamoDB table for locking, and IAM permissions. This Terraform
does *not* provision an S3 bucket to optimize.

After configuring the necessary authentication for Terraform, the following
steps can be used to provision:

[source,bash]
----
cargo lambda build --release --output-format zip
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
----

[NOTE]
====
Terraform configures the Lambda to run with the smallest amount of memory allowed. For a sizable table, this may not be sufficient for larger tables.
====

=== Environment variables

The following environment variables must be set for the function to run properly

|===
| Name | Value | Notes

| `DATALAKE_LOCATION`
| `s3://my-bucket-name/databases/bronze/http`
| The `s3://` URL of the desired table to optimize.


| `AWS_S3_LOCKING_PROVIDER`
| `dynamodb`
| This instructs the `deltalake` crate to use DynamoDB for locking to provide consistent writes into s3.
